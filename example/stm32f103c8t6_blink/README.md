This is an example on how to compile and run a bare bones applicaiton on an stm32f103c8t6 cortex-m3 ARM processor.

I have been searching for such an example and was not able to find one. So I found the needed files scatered around the internet and put together this example that actually works.

This example is designed to work with the board shown on picture. (stm32f103c8t6.jpg).
